I received the B.Eng. degree in process-, energy- and environmental engineering 
from Hannover University of Applied Sciences and Arts, in 2018, and the M.Sc. in
mechatronics from Leibniz University Hannover, in 2021. 

Currently, I am working toward the Ph.D.
degree at the [Vision and Fusion Laboratory (IES)](https://ies.anthropomatik.kit.edu/english/index.php) of Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, in collaboration with [Fraunhofer IOSB](https://www.iosb.fraunhofer.de/en.html). 
My main research interests include deep learning, video understanding, action recognition, and anticipation.

If you are interested in my research projects, please feel free to contact me.
